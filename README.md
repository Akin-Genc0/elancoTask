# CountryCheck Web Application

## Overview
This web application was built to meet the scenario requirements provided by **Elanco**. The main purpose of this application is to provide an intuitive way to explore country and city population data, visualize it effectively, and ensure ease of use for stakeholders.

## Development Process

### UI Design
- The user interface (UI) was initially designed in **Figma** to ensure the layout and design aligned with the project's goals.
- The focus was on creating a visually appealing and responsive design for a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Frontend Development
- The application was developed using **Vite** and **React**, chosen for their speed, scalability, and modern development features.
- The UI design from Figma was carefully implemented to match the envisioned layout and functionality.

### API Integration
- To fetch and display the required data, the application uses **REST APIs**.
- **Axios**, a popular React library, was used to handle API calls, ensuring smooth and efficient data fetching.

### Data Visualization
- For visualizing population data, the application leverages **Recharts**, a React-based charting library.
- A bar chart was implemented to visually compare country and city population data, making it easier for users to digest the information.

## Features

  Users can select a country and dynamically view its cities.

- **Population Comparison:**  
  Compare the total population of a country with the population of a selected city.

- **Flag Display:**  
  The application displays the flag of the selected country alongside the population data.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Displays "Not Available" messages for missing data or API call issues.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Ensures a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite:** For fast and efficient frontend development.
- **React:** To build a scalable and dynamic user interface.
- **Axios:** To handle REST API calls.
