     This web application was built to meet the scenario requirements provided by Elanco. 
      I started by designing the user interface (UI) in Figma. Once the design felt right 
      and aligned with the goal, I moved on to development using Vite and React.
      
      My first step in development was bringing the Figma design to life, 
      making sure the UI was not only visually appealing but also fully responsive for 
      a seamless experience across devices. Next, I integrated the REST API to fetch and display the data. 
      To handle the API calls and keep everything running smoothly, I used Axios, which is a popular library for React. 
      For the data visualization, I turned to Recharts to create a bar chart, making the population data more 
      visual and easier to digest.
